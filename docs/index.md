# What is it?

Thremulation Station is an approachable and small-scale threat emulation and detection range. It primarily uses Elastic Security and Atomic Redteam to emulate and detect adversary activity. 

The project is a collection of existing tools like VirtualBox and Vagrant an to deploy a local testing environment that requires only a _reasonably_ spec'd machine.

The bottom line: Cyber Threat Detection for your ***laptop***.
