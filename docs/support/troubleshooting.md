> A.K.A "It's broken and I dont know what to fix"

Once you are done playing in your sandbox, you need to clean things up. If you are in the middle of something and want to continue later, invoke a `vagrant suspend`. Otherwise, if you are done for the day invoke a `vagrant halt`.

Last but not least, if you have goofed up your install you can use `vagrant reload`. -->
