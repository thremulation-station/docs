## The Problem to Solve

Not everyone has a blade server heating their home from a closet...and not everyone, be it a junior hunter/red teamer who is just getting started or an operator with 20 years experience, is an engineer that can stitch all of the complex services together to grow or sharpen your skills.


## Use Cases

This project has many practical use cases, and we're excited to see how it's used. A few examples:

- Cyber Defense education
- Generating training data
- Threat intelligence training
- Writing and validating [detection rules](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules)
- Writing and testing threat [tactics and techniques](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/)


Let's look at an overview of the mini-range and demonstrate a basic exercise workflow.

## Workflow

There are a lot of moving pieces, but the main components of the project are:

1. The Elastic Stack - for analyzing data
2. Atomic Red - for generating adversary activity
3. Victim machines - to be targeted by adversary activity
