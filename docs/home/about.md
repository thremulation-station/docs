# About the Project


## TL;DR

If you're ready to skip all this info and get things running, jump to [installation](../getting-started/installation.md).


## How is Thremulation-Station different?

Not everyone has a blade server heating their home from a closet...and not everyone, be it a junior hunter/red teamer who is just getting started or an operator with 20 years experience, is an engineer that can stitch all of the complex services together to grow or sharpen your skills.


## Who is it for?

This project has many practical use cases, and we're excited to see how it's used. A few examples:

- Cyber Defense education
- Generating training data
- Threat intelligence training
- Writing and validating [detection rules](https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules)
- Writing and testing threat [tactics and techniques](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/)
